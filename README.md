# Data Visualization In Netflix

The primary objective of this project was to showcase the effective utilization of tools for data management and analysis. To illustrate this, I worked with a particularly insightful data set from Kaggle, which focused on titles available on Netflix. 

The process is simple, and I confidently tackled it head-on. The original data set contained several trailing commas, but with the use of the CSV library in Python, I was able to easily clean and process the data to be later analyzed in PostgreSQL!

In the two bar graphs outlined below is the country of origin, ordered by the rating, and the total percentage of titles based on that rating that said country has on Netflix.
