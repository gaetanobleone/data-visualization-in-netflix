# Data Visualization In Netflix

The primary objective of this project was to showcase the effective utilization of tools for data management and analysis. To illustrate this, I worked with a particularly insightful data set from Kaggle, which focused on titles available on Netflix. 

The process is simple, and I confidently tackled it head-on. The original data set contained several trailing commas, but with the use of the CSV library in Python, I was able to easily clean and process the data to be later analyzed in PostgreSQL!
